Django Login System
-------------------
The Django OAuth Toolkit makes use of the Django login system and we need
to deal with some URL endpoints.

They are specified in ```TestOAuth/urls.py``` and prefixed with
```accounts/```. I think they are pretty self explanatory and the sample
implementation is simple, you might need to write more code to make it
more useful.
